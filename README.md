## Introduction
Quark is a programming language that I created to learn how other programming languages work. It was inspired by many other languages such as **Python**, **C#**, **JavaScript**. Its interpreter was written in c#. Quark scripts have the file extension **.q**. 

Before using Quark:
For now there is ***no documentation*** and ***I don't know for how long i will be updating it***.

## Instalation
### Windows
1. Navigate to [the most recent release](https://github.com/din0x/Quark/releases) and download `Quark-Windows.zip`.
2. Unzip `Quark-Windows.zip` and open the unzipped folder.
3. Now you can run quark by draging .q files on `QuarkLang.exe`

## Here is some example code
```python
fun main() {
  print("Hello, World!");
}

main();
```
```python
fun double(x: int32): int32 {
  return 2 * x;
}

var y = 2;
print(double(y)); 
```
